# Data Upload & Visualization Demo

This is a lightweight proof-of-concept demonstrating:
- CSV/XLSX upload
- Data preview table
- Chart generation using Chart.js

This demo is intentionally scoped to show the core flow.
Authentication, backend APIs, and editable Word export
will be implemented in the full application.
